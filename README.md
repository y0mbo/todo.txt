# todo.txt
An implementation of Gina T's todo.txt format. 

# Why
I read somewhere that every developer eventually creates a todo app. I guess it's my turn.

I'm using it as an opportunity to build a full application as a showcase.

# Interesting tidbits
* I've used Regex plenty of times in my career. Still, it was fun to build up a test suite and make sure I had all the regular expressions I needed to parse the todo.txt format.
