# todo.txt

An implementation of Gina T's todo.txt format. This project currently does not have a name.

I read somewhere that every developer eventually creates a todo app. I guess it's my turn.

I'm using it as an opportunity to build a full application as a showcase.

## Documentation

The documentation for the project can be found in [/docs](/docs).

## Interesting tidbits

- I've used Regex plenty of times in my career. Still, it was fun to build up a test suite and make sure I had all the regular expressions I needed to parse the todo.txt format.
