# todo.txt

An implementation of Gina T's todo.txt format. This project currently does not have a name.

I read somewhere that every developer eventually creates a todo app. I guess it's my turn.

I'm using it as an opportunity to build a full application as a showcase.

## Documentation

The documentation for the project can be found in [/docs](/docs).

## Interesting tidbits

- I've used Regex plenty of times in my career. Still, it was fun to build up a test suite and make sure I had all the regular expressions I needed to parse the todo.txt format.


## Some random notes

One problem with todo lists is that they don't force you to make commitments that help you get things done.

The most organized people schedule the things that need to get done. Not only doe sthis include tasks that are urgent, but also those that are important but not urgent.

The best todo applications should include scheduling the tasks you want to get done in order to move them forward.
