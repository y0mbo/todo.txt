# ADR 000 - Use Todo.txt Format

## Context

There are many possibilities for the structure of a todo list's data. The simplest, by far, is a human-readable text-file.

Todo.txt at [http://todotxt.org/](http://todotxt.org/) provides a simple, text format usable on any device and well supported by a number of applications. This implementation will conform to the Todo.txt format.

## Status
